### 📋 Use Case

I have experimented with Claude to build an AI Chatbot for my Blog Content Assistant, and it successfully created a proper AI Chat agent which uses blog content and provides information sourced directly from the blog content.

### ✨ Features

- 🌐 **Configurable Blog Website** - Chat agent with customizable blog website choice
- 🏠 **Local AI Model** - Uses the Local AI Model Platform Ollama 3.2 - no paid subscription required
- ⚡ **Lightweight Design** - Very lightweight chat agent, but extensible for more robust implementations through Claude interaction

### 🛠️ Technologies/Languages/Tools

- 🐍 **Python** - Core development language
- 🎨 **Streamlit** - User interface framework
- 🧠 **Ollama** - Local AI model platform

### 💬 Sample Prompt Used to Generate the Code

#### 📋 Copy This Prompt:

```
You are an awesome AI Chat Assistant developer and I want to develop a chat agent for my blog website. When a user asks a question, it should provide details scraped from my blog.

Use Python to develop the agent

Use Streamlit for UI to create an agent for user interaction

Use Ollama 3.2 local models to provide chat assistance and code assistance based on user questions.

Display code blogs and other information well-formatted on the chat window using Streamlit UI

My blog https://aicodegeek.com and the agent should automatically go through all the links and scrape all pages. Provide this blog URL as configurable parameter in environment variables

Scraping should run first time when the agent starts and later it should be schedule-based and we should be able to configure the schedule interval.

Use Vector database or in-memory database to store embeddings and when each time it scrapes new content, just add delta embeddings to the vector database

Provide standalone script for Windows such that the chat agent should start automatically and as part of the script it should install required Python, Ollama 3.2 and other required libraries to run chat agent

Also manage the chat in memory chat history and be able to start new chat if user wants to start

Finally, the chat should be able to export as markdown or PDF
```
