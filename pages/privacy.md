# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: {{ 'now' | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}*

## Simple and Clear

This is a personal blog where I share knowledge, tutorials, and thoughts about web development and technology. Your privacy matters to me, so here's what you need to know:

## What I Collect

### When You Visit
- **Basic analytics**: I may use Google Analytics to see which posts are popular and how people find my blog
- **No personal data**: I don't collect names, emails, or personal information unless you specifically provide it

### When You Comment (if enabled)
- **Name and email**: Only if you choose to leave a comment
- **No selling**: I never sell or share your information with anyone

## Cookies

This blog may use simple cookies for:
- **Remembering your theme preference** (dark/light mode)
- **Analytics** (anonymous visitor statistics)
- **No tracking**: I don't use advertising cookies or complex tracking

You can disable cookies in your browser if you prefer.

## Third-Party Services

I may use:
- **Google Analytics**: For basic website statistics (anonymous)
- **GitHub Pages/Netlify**: For hosting this blog
- **Comment systems**: Like Disqus or GitHub comments (if enabled)

Each service has its own privacy policy.

## Your Rights

You can:
- **Contact me** if you have questions about your data
- **Request removal** of any comments you've made
- **Disable cookies** in your browser anytime

## Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your data, please [contact me]({{ '/contact/' | relative_url }}).

## Changes

I may update this policy occasionally. Any changes will be posted here with a new date.

**Bottom line**: This is just a simple blog for sharing knowledge. I respect your privacy and don't do anything sneaky with your data.
