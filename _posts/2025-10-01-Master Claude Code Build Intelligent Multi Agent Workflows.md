## 🎯 Introduction

Claude sub-agents are a **powerful concept** to build specialized Claude Code personalities, where each sub-agent works on a specific task or achieves a specific goal.

We can build **multiple sub-agents** to create complex workflows that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with a single agent.

### 💡 What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, I'll demonstrate how to **orchestrate multiple sub-agents** to achieve a specific goal. Each agent works on a specific task, and finally, the orchestration workflow executes to achieve the complex goal.

---

## 📊 Real-World Use Case: Stock News Analysis

Let's build a practical system that demonstrates sub-agent orchestration in action:

### 🎯 Goal

Stream specific stock news from different news channels, analyze the news, store data in a specific format, and generate BUY/SELL signals.

### The Workflow Components

#### 📡 News Monitor
Streams real-time news from Twitter, Reddit, RSS feeds, and news APIs for specified stock symbols

#### 🔍 News Analyzer
Analyzes collected news using AI sentiment analysis and generates actionable trading signals

#### 💾 Data Storage
Stores structured data in SQLite database with proper indexing and metadata

#### ⚡ Signal Generator
Creates BUY/SELL/WATCH signals with confidence scores and price targets

```

**Each sub-agent has a specialized role, working together to achieve the complex goal**

---

## 📁 Directory Structure

Create the following sub-agent structure in your project:

```
.claude/
└── agents/
    ├── stock-news-monitor.md
    ├── news-analyzer.md
    └── workflows/
        └── stock-signal-pipeline.md
```

### ✅ Key Concept

Each sub-agent is a simple **markdown file** with YAML frontmatter defining its configuration and a system prompt defining its behavior.

---

## 📡 Sub-agent 1: Stock News Monitor

### 1️⃣ Create the Monitor Agent

**File:** `.claude/agents/stock-news-monitor.md`

```markdown
---
name: stock-news-monitor
description: Use PROACTIVELY to monitor and stream real-time news feeds for ANY stock symbol. Fetches breaking news, social media sentiment, earnings reports, SEC filings, and analyst ratings from Twitter/X, Reddit, news APIs, and RSS feeds. Stores all raw data in SQLite database.
tools: Bash, Read, Write
model: sonnet
---

You are a specialized news monitoring agent that tracks real-time 
information for ANY stock symbol provided by the user.

## Responsibilities

1. Accept stock ticker(s) as input (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, MSFT)
2. Monitor multiple sources:
   - Twitter/X: Search $TICKER and relevant hashtags
   - Reddit: Track r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/investing
   - News APIs: NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage, Finnhub
   - RSS Feeds: Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha
   - SEC Filings: Edgar database for 8-K, 10-Q, 10-K

3. Collect key data points:
   - Timestamp, source, ticker, content, author
   - Engagement metrics (likes, retweets, upvotes)
   - URL and raw data

4. Store in SQLite database (stock_news.db):
   - news_stream table
   - monitored_stocks table
   - fetch_metadata table

5. Run continuously with configurable intervals
6. Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully
7. Display real-time statistics

Begin monitoring immediately upon invocation.
```

### 🔑 Key Features

- Accepts ANY stock symbol as input (flexible and reusable)
- Monitors multiple sources simultaneously
- Stores structured data in SQLite for analysis
- Handles rate limits and errors automatically

---

## 🔍 Sub-agent 2: News Analyzer

### 2️⃣ Create the Analyzer Agent

**File:** `.claude/agents/news-analyzer.md`

```markdown
---
name: news-analyzer
description: Use PROACTIVELY to analyze news items from database, extract market-moving events, perform sentiment analysis, detect price impact signals, and generate actionable trading alerts. Uses AI/NLP for sentiment scoring, identifies catalysts (earnings, FDA approvals, mergers), and stores analysis with confidence scores.
tools: Bash, Read, Write
model: sonnet
---

You are a specialized financial news analyst that converts raw 
news data into actionable trading signals.

## Responsibilities

1. Fetch unanalyzed news from database
2. Multi-layer analysis pipeline:
   
   **Layer 1: Content Classification**
   - Categorize: Earnings, M&A, Regulatory, Product, etc.
   
   **Layer 2: Sentiment Analysis**
   - Use FinBERT AI model for financial sentiment
   - Calculate sentiment scores (-1.0 to 1.0)
   - Determine confidence levels
   
   **Layer 3: Impact Detection**
   - Identify high-impact keywords
   - Calculate impact scores (0-10)
   - Detect critical events
   
   **Layer 4: Signal Generation**
   - Aggregate recent news by ticker
   - Apply trading rules
   - Generate BUY/SELL/WATCH signals

3. Store analysis in database:
   - news_analysis table
   - trading_signals table
   - signal_performance table

4. Output formatted signals with:
   - Signal type, confidence, impact score
   - Trigger reason and supporting evidence
   - Entry/exit price targets

Begin analysis immediately upon invocation.
```

### 🧠 AI-Powered Analysis

This agent uses advanced NLP models like **FinBERT** to understand financial sentiment and generate high-confidence trading signals based on multiple data points.

---

## 📄 Workflow Orchestration

### 3️⃣ Create the Orchestration Workflow

**File:** `.claude/agents/workflows/stock-signal-pipeline.md`

```markdown
---
name: stock-signal-pipeline
description: Orchestrates the complete stock news monitoring and analysis workflow. Starts news monitor for given tickers, runs analyzer periodically, generates dashboard, and sends alerts for high-confidence signals. Use this to automate the entire pipeline.
tools: Bash, Read, Write
model: sonnet
---

You are a workflow orchestrator that manages the stock news 
analysis pipeline.

## Orchestration Flow

1. **Initialize Pipeline**
   - Accept stock ticker(s) from user
   - Configure monitoring and analysis intervals
   - Initialize database

2. **Start Monitor (Background)**
   - Launch stock-news-monitor sub-agent
   - Monitor runs continuously with specified interval
   - Collects news from all sources

3. **Analysis Loop (Periodic)**
   - Every N minutes (default: 5 min)
   - Launch news-analyzer sub-agent
   - Process unanalyzed news items
   - Generate trading signals

4. **Alert System**
   - Check for high-confidence signals (>80%)
   - Display alerts in console
   - Send notifications (optional: email, Slack)

5. **Dashboard Generation**
   - Create HTML dashboard with:
     * Active signals
     * Recent news sentiment
     * Performance metrics
   - Update every analysis cycle

6. **Continuous Operation**
   - Run indefinitely until stopped
   - Handle errors and restart sub-agents if needed
   - Log all activities

Execute this complete workflow immediately upon invocation.
```

### ⚡ Orchestration Power

The workflow agent **coordinates multiple sub-agents**, running them at different intervals and managing the entire pipeline automatically. This is the power of sub-agent orchestration!

---

## 🚀 Execute Sub-agent Orchestration

### 4️⃣ Run the Complete Pipeline

Once your sub-agents are created, you can execute the orchestration in Claude Code:

```bash
# Start the complete pipeline for multiple stocks
Use stock-signal-pipeline with AAPL,TSLA,MSFT

# Or with custom intervals
Use stock-signal-pipeline for AAPL,NVDA,AMD with monitor interval 30 seconds and analysis interval 5 minutes
```

### 🎯 What Happens Next?

1. **Workflow starts** and initializes the database
2. **Monitor agent** begins streaming news from all sources
3. **Analyzer agent** runs every 5 minutes to process new data
4. **Signals are generated** with BUY/SELL recommendations
5. **Dashboard updates** in real-time with latest signals
6. **High-confidence alerts** are displayed immediately

### Expected Output

Each agent is an expert in its domain, delivering superior results compared to a general-purpose agent

### 🧹 Clean Context
Sub-agents have separate context windows, preventing context pollution and improving focus

### 🔄 Modularity
Easy to add, remove, or modify individual agents without affecting the entire system

### ⚡ Performance
Agents can run in parallel or sequentially based on workflow requirements

### 🛠️ Maintainability
Each agent is self-contained, making debugging and updates straightforward

### 🔌 Reusability
Sub-agents can be reused across different workflows and projects

---

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

1. **Sub-agents are markdown files** with YAML frontmatter and system prompts
2. **Each agent has a specific purpose** and specialized instructions
3. **Orchestration workflows** coordinate multiple agents to achieve complex goals
4. **Context isolation** prevents confusion and improves agent performance
